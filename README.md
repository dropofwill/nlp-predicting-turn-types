NLP Problem Set 3
===============

## TODO

More feature extraction (see feature ideas)

Preprocessing the text data: remove \*, repair turns <>, cleanup brackets \[\]

Combining feature different feature selection techniques with a feature union, possibly in the pipeline, [like here](http://zacstewart.com/2014/08/05/pipelines-of-featureunions-of-pipelines.html)?


## Feature ideas:

Question words as features: how, what, where, when, who, etc.?

*Features that won't be image content specific:*

Semantic parsing

Name Entity Recognition

Syntactic features
